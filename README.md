# Audio-Mystery-Game #JSEN
This is a audio based mystery game made with Edward Keenan, Szymon Baldyga ,and Julia Busby for our CMPU 203 class! If you need me to add you as a collaborator let me know! This repository will include the the last prototype we worked on: the hardware schematics and the processing code. Our client was legally blind, so we decided to create an audio based mystery game for her. The final prototype was planned to run on an arduino micro processor with braille buttons to  represent "A", "B", "C", "R" with ease. However, due to the time constraint on our project and the , the game can only run on processing. Press "A", "B", "C" to navigate through the story and make decisions. Press "R" to replay the dialogue. 

A big thanks to our voice actors!

Introduction:
Hello! Welcome to our mystery story. In a few minutes, you will embark on a mystery adventure. You will be able to talk to witnesses and suspects, investigate the crime scenes, and arrest a suspect. You will be given three choices at each point throughout the story (A, B, and C). Whenever you want to go over any notes/clues that you have discovered or arrest a suspect, go back to the scene of the crime and talk to one of the policemen. Let us know if you have any questions. We hope you enjoy this audio mystery adventure!

Updates to be done in the future!
