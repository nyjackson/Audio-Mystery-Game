the JSEN_textStoryNodes is almost identical to the normal JSEN_StoryNodes,
except that this version also displays text.

In order for text to be displayed (and for the program to run), you also need
a .txt file in the data folder for each story node. The names of these text files
should be the same as (not including filetype extension) the sound files 
corresponding to them.

For example, the first node has sound file "Introduction.wav", so the file
containing the text for that node shouls be called "Introduction.txt". 

Also, currently there are no files in the data folder. All the sound files should
be the same as those currently in the JSEN_StoryNodes_v2 data folder, so just copy
them from there when downloading this version.
